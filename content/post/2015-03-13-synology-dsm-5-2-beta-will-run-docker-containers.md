Synology have announced their latest beta this week. [DSM 5.2 Beta](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/5.2beta/) now gives you the abilty to run [Docker Containers](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/5.2beta/productivity) natively.   
  
This will be interesting for a bunch of vExperts, who use these devices. After I get vSphere 6.0 bedded in, I imagine that I will be looking at the option that this presents where I will be able to have a Docker implementation within the vSphere environment and play with the portability options by shifting them in and out of the Synology.  
  
Nice!  
  
Thanks to [Kendrick Coleman](https://twitter.com/KendrickColeman/) for [tweeting out](https://twitter.com/KendrickColeman/status/576362939680178176) on this one, cos I'd seem the emails but not read them yet.  
  
Unfortunately, having had a look at the Beta release notes, I am out of luck. Due to "the hardware requirement", Docker will be only available on the following models:   


  * 15-series: RS815RP+, RS815+, DS3615xs, DS2415+, DS1815+, DS1515+, DS415+ 
  * 14-series: RS3614xs+, RS3614RPxs, RS3614xs, RS2414+, RS2414RP+, RS814RP+, RS814+ 
  * 13-series: RS10613xs+, RS3413xs+, DS2413+, DS1813+, DS1513+, DS713+ 
  * 12-series: RS3412xs, RS812+, RS812RP+, RS3412RPxs, RS2212+, RS2212RP+, DS1812+, DS3612xs, DS1512+, DS412+ 
  * 11-series: RS3411RPxs, RS3411xs, DS3611xs 
  * 10-series: RS810RP+, RS810+, DS1010+, DS710+
