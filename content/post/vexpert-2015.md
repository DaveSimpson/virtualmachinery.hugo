Well, well, well. I'm pleased to say that I have been awarded the title of VMware vExpert for 2015, my first time! You can see the full list [here](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2015/02/vexpert-2014-announcement-2.html) on the VMTN site. Congratulations to all the new and returning vExperts named this year.  
 
It's rather humbling to gain this recognition and it really is great to see so many of the #LonVMUG folks who've helped me along the way be named as well. Cheers guys! Hopefully this will inspire me to do more in the future, I am really enjoying being a part of this community - I have so much I can learn and hopefully once in a while I can give something back.  
  
I must add my thanks to Corey Romero for the effort he puts in to this every year. At least for now I won't have to ask him for help to get me into the vExpert party at VMworld again:-)
