I wrote a [blog post](https://www.virtualmachinery.co.uk/post/2020-year-of-ci/) a few weeks ago explaining how I had updated the way my website got published, using a CI Pipeline. I hilariously (at the time) announced that 2020 was the Year of CI, not VDI. Since that time, things have changed. A lot.

I've spent the best part of four weeks at home along with most of the rest of the world as we all take shelter from the COVID-19 epidemic sweeping the globe. VDI use has rocketed and everyone I know seems to be on a Zoom call every day as corporate entities and voluntary organisations alike swap to remote working.

## Changes at Toastmasters ##
I've recently taken on the Sergeant at Arms role at [Worthing Speakers Club](https://worthingspeakers.club/) on a temporary basis. This meant that I was the person who brought all the stuff along and set everything up before each meeting - the pull-up banner, the sign-in sheets, the timing lights and so on. Rather similar to what I do on the day of a [London VMUG](https://community.vmug.com/communities/localcommunityhome?CommunityKey=0433de49-138a-4270-bc83-b64b8ea303a7) event. I did that once at Toastmasters, I think, before the UK's lockdown was imposed. Since then, I've championed Zoom within our club and we've seamlessly transitioned to online meetings as if this was totally normal for public speakers. I guess it *is* normal now. So these days, I set up Zoom meetings, make sure we can't get Zoom bombed and help out anyone who needs to get to grips with the technology. Digital Sergeant at Arms, I guess. I also helped out with a Regional event, so I'm pitching in to keep people connected and trying to provide some semblance of normality, which everyone needs right now.

## What this post is for ##
My CI post explained why I was revisiting my blog, I was in the middle of writing eight blog posts in a month as part of a [Toastmasters project](https://www.toastmasters.org/pathways-overview/pathways-persuasive-influence-path). The next part of that project was to present on it to my fellow Toastmasters and explain to them what I had learned in the process. This post is being used in a live demo of that process. I'll be publishing it during the speech that I am giving, using the CI pipeline, to show how it all hangs together. What could *possibly* go wrong? 

For some reason, I only have three minutes to get my point across, which is quite a challenge, being as I've taken the "what I've learned" question to a technical level, rather than saying it's hard to start a blog or find things to write about. No point making it easy!

This blog post only exists because I am presenting remotely. I was going to do a quick overview of the process without any visual aids, work the room, try and persuade someone else there that they could start to write a blog too. Now that we're remote I will be in front of my PC, so all I need to do is make a new post in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), paste this text in to it, set it not to be a draft and save it, do a bit of [Github](https://github.com/) magic and let the [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/automate-your-static-site-deployment-with-circleci/) pipeline do the rest....

So there you have it, Worthing Speakers, I like to challenge myself, no point just doing the basics in anything, push it to the next level and you'll learn a lot along the way!
