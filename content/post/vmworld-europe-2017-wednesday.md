Ah, VMworld Wednesday, the show is in full swing. Get past the second morning keynote and the messaging will change to focus on the VMworld Customer Appreciation Party with the Kaiser Chiefs playing.

## Keynote? ##

The VMTN Community area was once again my first destination of the day, to get settled before the keynote started. However, a conversation with a bunch of the people who had also gathered there meant that during the keynote itself, I wrote 2 words, neither of them in this post. But still, when you're in an ebb-and-flow containing the might of Alex Galbraith and Amit Panchal (fresh from their OpenTechcast Podcast Pat Gelsinger Interview Coup) Kim Bottu, Rebecca Fitzhugh, Lior Kamrat, Simon Eady, Chris Lewis, Simon Eady, Sam McGeown etc. etc. etc. then a repeat of a keynore from 2 weeks ago tends to get overlooked.

The consensus following the VMworld US keynotes was that VMware have "got their mojo back" and I am inclined to agree. There are some really promising developments going on at the moment and VMware do seem to be involved in quite a lot of them, what with all that Kubernetes related shenanigans with Google Cloud and the things they are doing with VMware Cloud on AWS and in the IBM Cloud. The growth rates and development curve on both vSAN and NSX both continue to impress, so the future does look quite promising. Given that we're at VMworld here, this is generally seen as a good thing.

## More TAM Sessions ##

As much as I am in danger of repeating myself, I like TAM sessions, so today I had a look at more vSAN, VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware Cloud on AWS. All pretty fundamental to the future success of VMware. A chunk of this stuff is NDA (or close to) so I'm not going to go in to a lot of detail on this, other than to say that the pace of development in any of these fields shows no sign of abating whatsoever. The only issue I had with TM Customer Central is that as the rooms are small, there is no aircon ant not a lot of air circulation, so even though I was taking notes, I found myself nodding once or twice at times today. Oops!

## Hunting for Lunch ## 

The worst part of the day, out of TAM Customer Central after a cracking session to watch everyone taking all the food grab bags in hall 8. OK, up to 8.1, only to be turned away as that location was shut and empty. Then we were sent to hall 7. A bit vague, but it seemed clear soon enough that I needed to go to the very back of the solutions exchange to wait in a huge queue for 20 minutes with half of VMworld. Then we're told that place is closing, go back to Hall 8.1. Ugh, after about 45 minutes to and fro, we managed to grab some cold pasta in a box, which was actually better than it sounded, but the feeding of thousands of geeks in a short timescale is something that is obviously hard to do! I usually bagged food from TAM Cuatomer Central to avoid things like this, but not this time. 

## Hall Crawl ##
Swag, beer, wine, more swag, product demonstrations, planning for the party. Bag Drop

## There ain't no party like a Consumer Appreciation Party ## 

Apparrently. 
Popcorn, Beer, Burgers, Beer, @KaiserChiefs. They were brilliant, went down a storm with the crowd, even though the lead singers jacket was apparently modelled on the VMware Code tshirt. What were the chances of that?
