I've been talking to my VMware Technical Account Manager about access to the vSphere Beta for a while now but in a surprising move (for me at least) VMware have just announced the public beta of vSphere 6. Of course, the usual beta rules apply, meaning no public disclosure about the contents of the beta, but since it's a public beta, anyone and everyone can sign up for it.  That means I don't need to tell you anything as you can go and look for yourself.   
  
**To join the Public Beta**  


  *  Browse to [https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/vsphere-beta](https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/vsphere-beta) and click the big  “JOIN NOW!” button on the right hand side!
  * Log in with your My VMware account. (it's easy to register for an account if you don’t have one).
  * Once you have an account and are logged in, you will have to accept the Master Software Beta Test Agreement (MSBTA) and Program Rules screens if you have not already done so in the past.
  * After doing this you should be in the vSphere Beta 2 community.

There are also a number of public webinars coming up to review a number of the intended new features which start on July 8th, so get in quick.... 

 

I'm downloading all the new goodies now, well, the basics of vSphere 6.0 at least. Seeya on the beta forums...
