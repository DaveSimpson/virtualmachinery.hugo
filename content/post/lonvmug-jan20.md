The first London VMUG meeting of 2020 was held at our usual location, TechUK, on Thursday 30th January and I'd been looking forward to it for quite a while. Sadly, I didn't make it all the way through the day, as I came down with some form of plague, which I am still trying to fully shake off! I don't think I looked very welcoming and I'm also sure that the rest of the leaders didn't really want me hanging around, so I was '*encouraged*' to go home early. I missed some good sessions, but I did manage to catch some of them before I left. 

If you don't know VMUG, where have you been?! I have a number of posts on it here on this blog, which will help shed light on what it's all about. The key part to remember is that this is a 'by the user, for the user' global organisation, so it is quite likely that one of the 200+ local groups is near you. Most are supported by VMware who supply speakers to give updates on all the new stuff, by sponsors who cover room costs, lunch costs etc. in return for telling you about their products which operate in the VMware infrastructure space and by community speakers, who will tell you about their pet project/from the trenches experiences/horror story or anything else they want to share - this is my favourite bit! 

Homing in on where I am, UK and Ireland, there's a number of groups and each organises a few meetings per year. Not every meeting is a full day or follows the same template, but most of the UKI based VMUG chapters run all-day events, often with more than one track running concurrently, so we are really spoilt for choice here on these small islands.
