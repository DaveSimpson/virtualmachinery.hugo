      <description>Over the last couple of weeks there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk about products being launched by VMware&amp;rsquo;s relatively new Cloud-Native Applications division. Now the launch date is here and even though it&amp;rsquo;s not quite launch time yet, the cat is out of the bag.
The products are currently known as;
Project Photon - A stripped down Linux version optimised to run on the vSphere hypervisor which is designed solely to host and package containers.</description>
