      <description>Just as I was thinking about starting this blog site, along came the public release of VMware&amp;rsquo;s entry in to the cloud space, vCloud Hybrid Service. I think that VMware first started telling me that I was on a &amp;ldquo;Journey to the Cloud&amp;rdquo; at VMworldÂ way back in 2008. I guess I have been meandering a bit since then as I am not sure that I have gone too far on that journey.</description>
