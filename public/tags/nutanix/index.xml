      <description>Kicking off the conference in the best way possible is attendance at TAM day (or Partner day if that&amp;rsquo;s your thing). TAM day is a relatively structured day with a number of sessions and of course, that access to the other parts of VMworld which are open on the Monday. There&amp;rsquo;s a growing number of people arriving on the Monday who are neither TAMÂ nor PEX attendees, but there&amp;rsquo;s other conference activities to keep them going too.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that the likes of Nutanix, and SimpliVity are the standard bearers for a whole raft of Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) products which are changing the way that we can think about our infrastructure these days. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely use cases out there. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re finally having your year of VDI, your FC fabric switches might be getting full, perhaps a new requirement needs separate storage or maybe, like me, you&amp;rsquo;re just HCI curious.</description>
