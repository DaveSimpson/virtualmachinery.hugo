      <description>Wow! I nearly didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. A particularly &amp;ldquo;late one at the office&amp;rdquo; the night before saw me get to bed just short of 4am, with the prospect of a couple of hours train journey for a 9 something LonVMUG start. So, forget all about starting the day at 6am then.
The late start to the day turned out to be particularly gutting as the Twitter chat around the event pretty much ceased whilst Frank Dennerman was doing his presentation, so I was pretty miffed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch it live as it was obviously getting everyone&amp;rsquo;s attention.</description>
