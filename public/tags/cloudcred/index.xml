      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a triple point Tuesday (well, it was when I wrote this and it&amp;rsquo;s OK, they are all triple point Tuesdays) so what better day to take a look at CloudCred and see what it&amp;rsquo;s all about? This is another post as part of the vDM30in30 series that I am trying to keep up with.
CloudCred was launched by VMware early in 2013 as a learning site, with a pretty solid gamification angle to it, which is what a lot of people were doing at the time.</description>

      <description>Why start a totally new blog about virtualisation topics at this late stage in the game, when there&amp;rsquo;s already a whole host of excellent sites out there? Sites I use myself regularly, too. I&amp;rsquo;ve shied away from this before, thinking that I will find it difficult to be on top of the game enough to provide useful content to complement existing sites.
Well, there&amp;rsquo;s this thing&amp;hellip; The other day I found out about a website calledCloudCred, which is basically a VMware backed educational website, which incentivises its members to develop knowledge and build collaborative teams via gamification.</description>
