      <description>This move was actually the culmination of a number of factors. The Blogger platform itself is fine, albeit proprietary and somewhat limited because of that, but you still need a bunch of other things to make that work. As with anything on the internet and I&amp;rsquo;ve sometimes had issues with the other aspects there. More than that though, this was simply a means to get myself into a newer format and learn something new along the way.</description>
