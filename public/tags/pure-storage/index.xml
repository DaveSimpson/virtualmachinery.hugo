      <description>This is a quick post to compare the releases of some Pure Storage products which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using over the past couple of months now.
I have to say I was very impressed with the towel 1.0 release, excellent capacity and coverage, a smooth side and a rough side, the well known Pure orange colour prominent throughout. At some 160 x 100 cm, there&amp;rsquo;s coverage for even the most, shall we say, &amp;lsquo;demanding&amp;rsquo; IT Professional.</description>
